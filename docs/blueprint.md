# **App Name**: JSON Canvas

## Core Features:

- Interactive JSON Tree: Display JSON data in a visually interactive tree view, allowing users to expand and collapse nodes to explore the data hierarchy.
- Real-Time Editing: Enable users to directly edit JSON values within the tree view with real-time updates.
- Tabbed Document Interface: Provide tabbed interface for managing multiple JSON documents or sections within a single workspace.
- AI-Powered Summarization: Allow users to summarize lengthy JSON values or sections using an AI tool, making it easier to grasp the main points.
- JSON Formatting and Syntax Highlighting: Include a toggle to switch between raw JSON view and a formatted, human-readable view with syntax highlighting.
- JSON Import/Export: Implement import and export functionalities for loading and saving JSON files, ensuring data portability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant indigo (#667eea) to bring a sense of structure and calm to the potentially overwhelming nature of JSON data.
- Background color: A light, desaturated lavender (#f0f2f9) will allow elements of the interface to 'float' clearly in the user's view, ensuring the focus is on the data being worked on.
- Accent color: A bold purple (#9370db) offers a sense of creativity, while making interactive elements 'pop' on the screen. When working together with Indigo, the design will evoke feelings of forward progress.
- Use a clear and monospaced font for the JSON data to improve readability and differentiate code from UI text.
- Implement minimalist and intuitive icons for actions like editing, saving, and expanding/collapsing nodes.
- Employ a clean, well-spaced layout to avoid visual clutter, especially given the hierarchical nature of JSON data.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for expanding/collapsing nodes and other interactions to enhance user experience.
